&NewLine;

`pytnt/pytnt/__init__.py`

Importing necessary modules:\
processTNT.TNTfile: This module likely contains the core functionality to read and process the TNT files.
utils.unsqueeze: A utility function that may be used to reshape the data.
utils.save_gnuplot_matrix: A function to save the processed data in a format suitable for Gnuplot.
utils.dump_params_txt: A function to save the parameters of the TNT file in a text format.&NewLine;

The script does not contain any executable code, as it is likely a part of a larger package or module. The actual functionality is encapsulated within the imported modules and functions.&NewLine;

`pytnt/pytnt/find_TNMR_backup_files.py`

Imports and Utility Functions:\
The script imports necessary modules and functions, including os, re, subprocess, and argparse.
It also defines a pushdir context manager to change the current working directory and restore it later.&NewLine;&NewLine;

Functions for Possible Actions:\
The script defines several functions that can be used as actions when a backup file is found, such as printing the filename, printing the full file path, deleting the file, or deleting the file using git rm or svn rm.&NewLine;&NewLine;

Command-Line Argument Handling:\
The script uses argparse to handle command-line arguments, including the path to search, the actions to perform (print, delete, etc.), and a quiet mode.
The main function is defined to parse the arguments and call the find_TNMR_backup_files function with the specified options.&NewLine;&NewLine;

Searching for Backup Files:&NewLine;
The find_TNMR_backup_files function walks through the specified directory and its subdirectories, searching for files that match the pattern ".*\\.tnt_\d+\\.tnt$" (which indicates a backup file).
For each backup file found, the function checks if there is a corresponding base file (the main data file without the backup suffix) and compares the file sizes and modification times.
If the backup file is larger or newer than the base file, it is kept. Otherwise, the specified actions are performed on the backup file (e.g., printing or deleting it).
The main purpose of this script is to help users of the Tecmag TNMR software identify and potentially remove unnecessary backup files, which can accumulate and take up storage space. The script provides flexibility by allowing users to specify the actions to be taken on the found backup files.&NewLine;&NewLine;

`pytnt/pytnt/processTNT.py`

The provided Python script is defining custom numpy dtype structures for reading TNT files, which are a file format used by the Tecmag TNMR software. Here's a breakdown of what the script is doing:&NewLine;

The script imports the necessary modules, including re and numpy.&NewLine;

It defines a regular expression pattern Magic_re to match the "TNT1.xxx" magic string at the beginning of a TNT file.&NewLine;&NewLine;

The script then defines several dtype structures:&NewLine;

Magic: A simple 8-byte string dtype.\
TLV: A structured dtype with fields for "tag" (4-byte string), "bool" (4-byte unsigned integer), and "length" (4-byte unsigned integer).\
TMAG: A complex structured dtype with various fields related to the NMR experiment, such as number of data points, frequencies, acquisition parameters, and timing information.\
GridAndAxis: A structured dtype for storing information about grid and axis display settings.\
TMG2: An extensive structured dtype for storing various display and processing parameters, including apodization, phasing, integration, and peak detection settings.\
These dtype definitions are likely used elsewhere in the pytnt project to efficiently read and process the data stored in TNT files, allowing the data to be manipulated using numpy arrays.&NewLine;&NewLine;

The comments in the script provide some additional context and explanations for the meaning of certain fields within the TNT file format, based on the documentation provided with the Tecmag TNMR software.&NewLine;

### this one is important!! similar to what read files are trying to do
`pytnt/pytnt/TNTdtypes.py`&NewLine;

The provided Python script defines a TNTfile class that is responsible for loading and processing data from TNT files, which are a file format used by the Tecmag TNMR software. Specifically, this script does the following:&NewLine;

It defines the TNTfile class, which takes a TNT file path and an encoding as input.&NewLine;

In the __init__ method, the script:\
Reads the "magic" string at the beginning of the file to validate that it's a valid TNT file.\
Reads the section headers from the file and stores them in an ordered dictionary.\
Finds and parses the delay tables from the file.\
Reads the TMAG and TMG2 sections of the file and stores them as attributes of the TNTfile object.\
Reads the actual data from the "DATA" section of the file and stores it as a NumPy memmap.\
The script defines several properties and methods to facilitate working with the loaded TNT data:&NewLine;&NewLine;

start_time, finish_time, and date: Properties that return the start time, finish time, and save date of the NMR acquisition, respectively.\
__getattr__: A method that allows accessing members of the TMAG and TMG2 structures as attributes of the TNTfile object.
LBfft: A method that performs a Lorentz-Gaussian apodization, FFT, and phase correction on the data.\
freq_Hz, freq_ppm, and fid_times: Methods that return the frequency axis in Hz, frequency axis in ppm, and time axis for the FID, respectively.\
ppm_points and ppm_points_reverse: Methods that return the indices of the spectrum corresponding to a given ppm range.
spec_acq_time: A method that calculates the total time taken to acquire one spectrum.\
spec_times: A method that returns the time at which the acquisition of each spectrum began.\
n_complete_spec: A method that returns the number of spectra where all the scans have been completed.\
decode: A method that decodes a byte string using the file's encoding.&NewLine;&NewLine;

In summary, this script provides a convenient way to load and work with data from TNT files, abstracting away the details of the file format and providing a set of utility methods to extract and manipulate the data.&NewLine;


### also important, functions refrenced throughout pytnt &NewLine;
`pytnt/pytnt/utils.py`&NewLine;

The provided script defines several utility functions that are used in the pytnt project:&NewLine;&NewLine;

unsqueeze(M, new_ndim=4): This function adds extra dimensions to a matrix so that it has the desired dimensionality. It is likely used to ensure that the data has the correct shape for processing.\
convert_si(si_num_list): This function takes a list of strings representing SI-prefixed numbers (e.g., "1.2m", "10k") and converts them to a NumPy array of floating-point values with the appropriate scaling.\
read_pascal_string(data, number_type='<i4', encoding='ascii'): This function reads a Pascal-style string from the provided data. It first reads the length of the string, then reads the string itself, and returns the decoded string.\
save_gnuplot_matrix(tnt, mat_file, max_ppm=np.Inf, min_ppm=-np.Inf, altDATA=None, times=None, logfile=None): This function saves a matrix in a format suitable for use as a Gnuplot "binary matrix". It selects a subset of the data based on the provided ppm range, and writes the real part of the data to the specified file, with the frequency axis in the first row and the acquisition time in the first column.\
dump_params_txt(tnt, txtfile): This function writes the acquisition (TMAG) and processing (TMG2) parameters from the TNTfile object to a text file.&NewLine;&NewLine;

These utility functions provide various data manipulation and file I/O capabilities that are likely used throughout the pytnt project to work with TNT files and their associated data.&NewLine;
