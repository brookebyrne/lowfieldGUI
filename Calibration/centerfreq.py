# Perform a frequency sweep or frequency detection routine
#call the tecmag software to do that, would need a write function?


#read the the center frequency from the TNT file


# the output of this is the spectrum data, which is a numpy array of the frequency and intensity and the FID date which 
#is a numpy array of the time and intensity

#center freq is the frequency at which the maximum signal intensity is detected.




#store center freq in a variable
